(PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY ON HOLD INDEFINTELY)


Greetings
Thank you for downloading my project! This was initially created as a task for my bootcamp, however I decided to continue this project and develop it further.

The features are as follows:
- Fully functioning menu
- Points system with a highscore
- Question that requires user input that are then validated with a validator method

The Mechanics of the program are as follows:
- Switch and loop used for menu
- Questons and answers are stored in objects that are later referenced in methods
- Loop is used to cycle through each question
- Methods are used to start the game as well as validate the answers and present the end results of the game

Features to be implemented are as follows:
- More questions used (IMPLEMENTED)
- A highscore comparison system
- A lives system
- Question variation (for example multiple answer or yes/no questions)
- Timer
- User difficulty option (reduces or increases time on timer depending on chosen option)
